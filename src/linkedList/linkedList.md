# Linked List
1. A linked list is linear collection of nodes which has two parts - data and reference to the next node.
2. Together they form a sequence of nodes

## Pros
1. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during **iteration**.

## Drawbacks
1. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). 
2. Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. 
3. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.
