// LINKED LIST
// A linked list is linear collection of nodes which has two parts - data and reference to the next node.
// Together they form a sequence of nodes

// DRAWBACKS
// A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). 
// Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. 
// Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.
